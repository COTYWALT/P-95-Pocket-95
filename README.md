This is a personal project of mine over the past few days. I have compiled PCem into a portable, single EXE file that contains a fully updated Windows 95 machine. The specs are a Socket 7 75mhz (can be increased to 500 depending on your PC) with 128mb RAM, 2 SLI VooDoo 2 cards with 28mb total VRAM, Sound Blaster AWE32 with 28mb on-board RAM, 32GB virtual HDD that will expand over time depending on the size (the current EXE itself is just 300mb). It also includes INTERNET, by default, it will automatically connect using your current ISP, then translate it to the Windows OS as an ethernet connection. Browsing the web has never been so much fun! .. and laggy, and horrible and oh god, it barely works but Internet Explorer is still kicking! If you have retail games that are still online, such as Half-Life Deathmatch or Quake, you can play online with other people! Supports Software Rendering for DOS-based titles, DirectX for Hardware Rendering and OPENGL for the VooDoos (or any other GPU you want), Floppy Drives and CD's, it is a real system with real emulated hardware. That means you can install anything that you want and it will run, assuming it originally ran on Windows 95 in the first place. PCem is cycle-rate accurate, this means games like Daggerfall WILL NOT freak out (animations) and will run properly. The best part? Everything is entirely customizable. Want to upgrade to a VooDoo 3 instead of VooDoo 2? It's easy as opening the setting and just changing the card. Just simply click the EXE file and it will launch directly into the machine. Supports gaming, that was the whole idea of this but it's also fun to just mess around with a 20+ year old operating system.

If you have the hardware to meet the default requirements, which I have set to be extremely optimized for most people, then you can expect to hit frame-rates up to the 30s-50s in games like Quake, Half-Life, Unreal and more. Any DOS game will run perfectly. Try playing something like Far Cry that was released in 2004 and feel the extreme pain of people who never upgraded to Windows XP and had to deal with constant crashes and horrible juttery frame-rates. Have fun. :)

This took a very long time to compile using the software I chose (Cameyo Professional), if you enjoy it or would like to support me in anyway, you can choose to do so by either mailing me cats, or sending me Final Fantasy music to listen to while I make other fun projects like this one. :) Do not send me money, I will probably buy weed with it. I am always making videos, but I suffer from a deep social anxiety, so a lot of my project remains unlisted and hidden. Maybe when I start reaching more people, I will let more stuff like this out for others to try.

Big thanks to PCem, an 86 emulator that this entirely runs on. It would not have been possible without it, obviously.

You are absolutely free to share this, reupload it, or make your own video. Just please credit me and PCem for the emulator :D

SOMEONE SHOW MICHAEL MJD THIS!

IMPORTANT. Since this is an embedded file, it may not open properly the first time. If you find that it fails to boot, then it did not have enough time to call the reference file. Simply DELETE the DATA folder, re-run the EXE file. If it says the file is open when trying to delete, close PCem from the task-manager then try again. If you get a "BIOS error" and Windows starts up trying to detect new hardware, delete the DATA folder and repeat the steps above. It may take a few tries depending on the speed of your CPU to get Windows to boot correctly. If you have a fast CPU, it should open the first time with no issues. I will try to fix this in the next update but it's just a side effect of the packaging library. There are no files left after removing the program. Everything from settings, storage, to registry files are stored in a virtual environment (DATA folder), using the Cameyo library packager. This means you can freely store this on a USB device and take it with you, kind of like a 5000$ laptop back then! If you want to fully start over with a fresh copy of Windows, simply delete the DATA folder and re-run the EXE. If you want to remove it, just drag it to the recycle bin and say your final regards. THIS IS PCEM, please refer to their website for support. I have only built the wrapper that contains the files. If you play around, you may find that you can create your own computers in this as well, including installing other OS's wink wink. ;)

Fullscreen mode can be activated with CTRL+ALT+PG UP (may need to hold the FN key on your keyboard) then PG DN for Windowed mode.
